# Optimizing Road Connectivity in Rural and Hilly Regions of India
- In rural areas of India, particularly in hilly regions, road connectivity is a significant
challenge. Many towns and villages remain isolated due to difficult terrain, inadequate
infrastructure, and a lack of proper planning, making daily commutes, trade, and access
to essential services like healthcare extremely difficult. This lack of connectivity hampers
overall economic development and social well-being.

- The challenge for participants is to develop a system that identifies regions in rural, hilly
terrains where new roads need to be constructed or existing roads require upgrading. By
analyzing geographic data, terrain conditions, and economic factors, participants must
devise a solution that optimizes road planning in the most cost-effective way possible.
The system should highlight areas where road construction is necessary for better
connectivity and recommend regions where current roads need enhancement due to wear,
damage, or increased traffic.

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method that uses decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
2. **Gradient Boosting**: An iterative technique for optimizing prediction models by minimizing loss functions.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
4. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A robust algorithm for classification tasks that aims to find the hyperplane that best separates data points.
5. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning model used for processing and classifying images, ideal for image-related tasks in this project.
