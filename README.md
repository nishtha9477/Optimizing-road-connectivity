- **Google Maps Integration**: Displays real-world maps for visual analysis and interaction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive web-based UI for easy access and usability.
- **Scalable Backend**: Built with Python to ensure efficient data processing.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes serialized models for quick inference.

## Machine Learning Models

1. **Random Forest**: A powerful ensemble method that uses decision trees for classification and regression tasks.
2. **Gradient Boosting**: An iterative technique for optimizing prediction models by minimizing loss functions.
3. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification problems.
4. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: A robust algorithm for classification tasks that aims to find the hyperplane that best separates data points.
5. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning model used for processing and classifying images, ideal for image-related tasks in this project.
